it's really a robot with a missile launcher arm.


this seems a good place to put my homework, yes?


intro & project overview - maya is a powerful software for creating in the 3D environment. from wireframe to finished product, this software has it all.

navigating the 3D viewport - on a 2D screen, you must be able to move your perspective around the environment to develop a 3D scene.

working with the UI - buttons! i would even include hotkeys to this. from simply closing the software to rendering a scene for 3 hours just to find out you need to trash the render to edit.. the interface is how you tell the software what to do.

creating a maya project - this isn't as easy as it sounds to define. sure, file > new. but, you need to name it properly, you need to save it in several places, perhaps even different file types, on different computers, test it on multiple resolutions on multiple screens and i could probably go on.

working with scene files - (this question doesn't match the video, they talked more about the last part ^) it is a good idea to save save save because this level of development, to be honest- presses boundaries. of which, can crash your computer. if it wasn't saved, all the work can easily be lost. it is good to know what the file is intended for before even starting, so you know how to present it.

viewport shading and selection modes - we can shade our objects, work with the wireframe or both. we can select objects with various tools and can even select or deselect with a simple hotkey. it's important to be able to get as specific as possible on what you want to work on.

transforming objects in maya - this is where objects begin to come to life. shaping, molding, sculpting, moving, resizing, cropping and more. there's a set of tools that can make all of this happen. 

using component mode - this lets us select specific egdges, faces and verticies of objects to develop them more naturally. this aids in transforming a large deal, as well as other uses.

accessing scene objects - there's another way to select objects, by the outliner- which could be used if there are lots of objects, or could be used if an object is burried within another.

grouping and parenting in maya - we can group objects together to make them transform together for our scene, and still be able to make some of them transform separately.

using the hotbox - this is a quick way to do almost anything on the interface with a universal hotkey function. this is a very nice work-around for the learning time of all the hotkeys, and seems to be one of those million-dollar-ideas to me.
